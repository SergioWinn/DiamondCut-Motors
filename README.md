# DiamondCut Motors ðŸš— - An Interaction Design Project

## Project Description
DiamondCut Motors is an interface prototype for a car dealership website, designed with a focus on Human and Computer Interaction (HCI) principles. This project aims to create an intuitive, efficient, and visually pleasing user experience. It is built entirely using front-end technologies.

## Design & HCI Principles Applied
In this project, I focused on several key HCI principles:
* **Clarity:** The interface is designed to be easily understood. Familiar icons and clear labels are used to guide the user.
* **User Control:** Users have the freedom to navigate, filter searches, and return to previous steps with ease.
* **Feedback:** Interactive elements like buttons and forms provide visual feedback (e.g., color changes on hover) to let the user know their actions are being registered by the system.
* **Consistency:** The color scheme, typography, and layout are kept consistent across all pages to reduce the user's cognitive load.
